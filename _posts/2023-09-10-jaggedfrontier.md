I have been a follower of [Ethan Mollick](https://twitter.com/emollick?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) on Twitter, *formerly known as X*, for a good while now. What I really like about him is his consistency in sourcing big-picture papers that attempt to capture how AI might be used in days to come. He's also provides great resources in LLM usage so please check him out of those things interest you. 

This paper immediately peaked my interest, in the same vein as the [industrial GPT-4 paper](/_posts/2023-08-04-industrialcontrolgpt4.md) did, because it explores real world implications of generative AI. Despite all the tech bros on Twitter hyping up all the ways you should, or even **need**, to be using GPT in your daily life we haven't really seen tangible proof if its efficacy yet. So is generative AI really all that? Well if we're to believe this group at Harvard Business School, then yes...it seems like the tech bros were right all along. Consultants at BCG who use AI finished 12.2% more tasks on average, completed tasks 25.1% more quickly, and produced 40% higher quality results than those without. This numbers are huge, like you can't ignore this. It really seems like the adoption of AI will be a clear divisor between growing and stagnating companies over the next 10 years. If you're leading a team in any capacity you need to consider the adoption of these technologies before others get ahead
