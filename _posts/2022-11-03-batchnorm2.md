title: "How Does Batch Normalization Help Optimization?"
categories: [Deep Learning]

A follow up to the original batch normalization paper, the authors suggest that BatchNormâ€™s effectiveness has little to do with the reduction of the so-called internal covariate shift. Instead they uncover a more fundamental impact of BatchNorm on the training process: it makes the optimization landscape significantly smoother. This smoothness induces a more predictive and stable behavior of the gradient, allowing for faster training.
