Hello! My name is Leon Ericsson and I am currently a final year Master's student in the field of computer science. My interests lie in 

- Deep Learning
- Computer Vision 
- NLP 
- AI Health. 

Following my graduation I hope to pursue a career within the industry as a research scientist/engineer or as a PhD student.

On this blog, I'll be sharing summaries and personal thoughts on the latest (with a healthy dose of classic) research and publications in my areas of interest. While primarily for my own edification, I hope to provide a helpful resource for others interested in staying up-to-date on the latest developments in these fields. I'll share my insights and perspectives as I continue to learn and grow in my understanding of these technologies.

Thank you for visiting my blog and I hope you find it helpful and informative. Please feel free to leave comments or reach out to me with any questions or thoughts you may have.

## Jekyll
This blog is built using a Jekyll-powered theme called Reverie. Jekyll is a static site generator that is written in Ruby. It is used to build and generate static websites from templates and content written in Markdown, Liquid, and other formats. Jekyll is often used to build blogs, documentation websites, and other types of sites where the content doesn't change frequently. It is designed to be easy to use, fast, and flexible, and it integrates well with version control systems like Git.
